<span style="color:#000000;font-family:Tahoma;font-size:19px;line-height:27px;">Well here we are at the Easter weekend, and still separated, but hopefully together in our Lord. <br>This weekend though is something to celebrate and we will be doing it by launching <strong>‘CBT’ – Church By Telephone</strong>! Having run a trial last weekend, which want well, I will be doing two services via the telephone. <br>One on <strong>Good Friday at 2.30pm</strong>, which will be a meditation for Good Friday, if you want to join in saying the Psalm please have this News Sheet with you – Psalm 22.1-11 (see page 2). It would be good to have a cross with you to focus on. <br>On <strong>Easter Sunday at 10.30am </strong>there will be a service of prayer and praise. We will use the readings in this News Sheet, and the service sheet that you will also have received. It is simple to join in, but it is up to you if you do so or not, no one will know. For this service I suggest you have a candle to light if you are able. Here are the instructions for joining the services. <br><strong>Instructions </strong><br>You will be joining a virtual ‘conference room’ facilitated by WhyPay. You will be able to hear the service, but anything you say will not be heard by anyone on the telephone, only those physically with you. So if you want to put your phone on ‘speaker phone’ so you can put it down, so that those with you can listen that is fine, and no one else will hear you talking to the dog, or your clock chiming etc. <br>To start please telephone 0333 0110 945 – you will be asked for the Conference Room number, which <br>is: 78397412# - the # key is most important (found on the bottom right of most phone pads), - you will then be asked for a Pin, which <br>is: 1376# - again don’t forget the # key. <br>These steps ensure the security of the ‘room’ and that only those invited can be 2 w15 part of the ‘conference’ or in our case, service.<br><br>Once you are in you just listen. If you happen to be the first one to dial in, you will be told you are on your own but please wait for others. If you dial in before the service starts you may just hear silence, please be patient, I will start at the appointed time (by my clock ☺). <br>You can join even after the service has started and leave (by putting the phone down/disconnecting the call) at any time., and no one will know! <br>Just in case you were wondering (and I’m sure some of you will!) music is not an option. I have tried it and it sounds as though it is being played under water! So, sorry - you will have to provide your own. <br>This will become the pattern for future Sundays with a service each week at 10.30am for anyone who wants to be part of it. </span>

They put him to death by hanging him on a tree; 40but God raised him on the third day and allowed him to appear, 41not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. 42He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one ordained by God as judge of the living and the dead. 43All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.’ <br><br><strong>PSALM - </strong>118.14-24 <br></span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:19px;line-height:32px;">14 The Lord is my strength and my song, and he has become my salvation. </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Tahoma;font-size:19px;line-height:31px;"><br></span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:19px;line-height:31px;">15 Joyful shouts of salvation sound from the tents of the righteous: </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Tahoma;font-size:19px;line-height:32px;"><br></span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:19px;line-height:32px;">16 ‘The right hand of the Lord does mighty deeds; the right hand of the Lord raises up; the right hand of the Lord does mighty deeds.’ </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Tahoma;font-size:19px;line-height:32px;"><br></span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:19px;line-height:32px;">17 I shall not die, but live and declare the works of the Lord. </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Tahoma;font-size:19px;line-height:31px;"><br></span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:19px;line-height:31px;">18 The Lord has punished me sorely, but he has not given me over to death. </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Tahoma;font-size:19px;line-height:32px;"><br></span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:19px;line-height:32px;">19 Open to me the gates of righteousness, that I may enter and give thanks to the Lord. </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Tahoma;font-size:19px;line-height:31px;"><br></span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:19px;line-height:31px;">20 This is the gate of the Lord; the righteous shall enter through it.</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Tahoma;font-size:19px;line-height:32px;"><br></span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:19px;line-height:32px;">21 I will give thanks to you, for you have answered me and have become my salvation. </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Tahoma;font-size:19px;line-height:31px;"><br></span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:19px;line-height:31px;">22 The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone. </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Tahoma;font-size:19px;line-height:32px;"><br></span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:19px;line-height:32px;">23 This is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes. </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Tahoma;font-size:19px;line-height:32px;"><br></span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:19px;line-height:32px;">24 This is the day that the Lord has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it <br><br></span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Tahoma;font-size:19px;line-height:32px;"><strong>GOSPEL READING – </strong>John 20.1-18 <br>1Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb. 2So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, ‘They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.’ 3Then Peter and the other disciple set out and went towards the tomb. 4The two were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. 5He bent down to look in and saw the linen wrappings lying there, but he did not go in. 6Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the linen wrappings lying there, 7and the cloth that had been on Jesus’ head, not lying with the linen wrappings but rolled up in a place by itself. 8Then the other disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed; 9for as yet they did not understand the scripture, that he must rise from the dead. 10Then the disciples returned to their homes. <br>11But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb; 12and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had been lying, one at the head and the other at the feet. 13They said to her, ‘Woman, why are you weeping?’ She said to them, ‘They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.’ 14When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus. 15Jesus said to her, ‘Woman, why are you weeping? For whom are you looking?’ Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, ‘Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.’ 16Jesus said to her, ‘Mary!’ She turned and said to him in Hebrew, ‘Rabbouni!’ which means Teacher. 17Jesus said to her, ‘Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, “I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.“’ 18Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, ‘I have seen the Lord’; and she told them that he had said these things to her. </span>

(John 20.19) <br>Ever present God, <br>be with us in our isolation, <br>be close to us in our distancing, <br>be healing in our sickness, <br>be joy in our sadness, <br>be light in our darkness, <br>be wisdom in our confusion, <br>be all that is familiar when all is unfamiliar, <br>that when the doors reopen <br>we may with the zeal of Pentecost <br>inhabit our communities <br>and speak of your goodness <br>to an emerging world. <br>For Jesus’ sake. <strong>Amen. </strong><br><br>Please pray for all who are involved in the response to this crisis worldwide. <br>Loving God, <br>source of healing and comfort, <br>fill us with your grace, <br>that the sick may be made whole, <br>that those who care for us may be strengthened, <br>that the anxious may be calmed, <br>and those most vulnerable be protected <br>in the power of Spirit <br>in the faith of Jesus Christ our Lord. <strong>Amen. </strong></span>
